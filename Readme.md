Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using a CI/CD pipeline. The source code is managed in GitHub, and deployments are triggered automatically on code changes.

Prerequisites
AWS account with Elastic Beanstalk access

GitHub account with repository access

AWS CLI and EB CLI installed (for manual deployment)

Application code (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)

Setup
Clone the repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Configure AWS CLI:

text
aws configure
Initialize Elastic Beanstalk environment (if not already created):

text
eb init
eb create your-env-name
Deployment
Automated Deployment (Recommended)

The project uses GitHub Actions/AWS CodePipeline to deploy automatically to Elastic Beanstalk on every push to the main branch.

Ensure your AWS credentials are set as secrets in your GitHub repository (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).

Manual Deployment

To deploy manually, use the EB CLI:

text
eb deploy
Customization
Update environment variables in the Elastic Beanstalk console or via .ebextensions files.

Modify the workflow file in .github/workflows/ for custom CI/CD steps.
